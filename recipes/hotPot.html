    <h3>How to cook</h3>
    <p>If you’re new to hot pot, it’s a really low stress way to have a fun 
        and festive meal with people you love. On this particular weekend, 
        we’re celebrating my birthday, but hot pot needs no excuses to be 
        enjoyed on any day of the year. <br> 

        At its core, hot pot is a social experience where you cook raw foods 
        in a communal pot of flavored broth or soup. It has many variations 
        across almost every Asian country, and a handful of European ones as 
        well.</p>
        <br>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Step 1</b> <br>
            Partially frozen is significantly easier to cut into 
            thin slices, since it holds its shape when you cut it.
            <ul> 
                <li>Let’s say you have meat that’s 100% frozen and you 
                    wanted to prepare hot pot on a Saturday, On Friday 
                    night, you’d move the meat out of the freezer and 
                    into the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, 
                    the meat should be partially thawed.
                </li>
                <li>If you were starting with fresh meat, then you’d 
                    place it in the freezer for about one to two hours.
                </li>
                <li>With both of these methods, the amount of time you 
                    freeze and thaw depends on your refrigerator and the 
                    thickness of your meat, but this is a good starting 
                    point.
                </li>
                <li>The meat should be still hard, but it should have 
                    some give. You’ll know if it’s still too frozen if you 
                    have a really hard time cutting it, in which case you 
                    can let it thaw for another hour or two. If the meat 
                    moves around when you try to cut it, then it’s too 
                    thawed, in which case you can freeze it again for 
                    another 30 minutes.
                </li>
            
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 2</b> <br>
            <p>We didn't really cover this in too much depth in our videos, 
                since there's not much to do other than wash the vegetables 
                and to make any necessary cuts.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it's important to wash and rinse your 
                vegetables / mushrooms.</p>
            <p>If you're using tofu (make sure it's firm), then cut it into 
                cubes.</p>    
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 3</b> <br>
            <p>Carefully cut each slab of meat into 1-2 mm slices. We want 
                thin slices of meat, since it's very important that these 
                meats are able to cook quickly in our boiling hot pot.</p>
            <p>As long as these meats have been partially thawed, these 
                steps are pretty easy. We just need to make sure that our 
                fingers are positioned correctly throughout the slicing, and 
                particularly when we're looking to slice off the end of a 
                piece.</p>
            <p>We'll also be marinading our pork chop slices (1 lb). In an 
                empty bowl, mix salt (0.50 tsp), baking soda (0.50 tsp), 
                cornstarch (2 tsp), and water (1 tbsp), and then mix the 
                pork chop with it.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 4</b> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Start to remove the innards by cutting down the middle 
                    with a knife. Pull out the entrails, the clear quill, 
                    and the purple membrane on the outside of the body.</li>
                <li>To save the tentacles, cut away the innards hanging 
                    underneath the eyes. We'll save the tentacles, and 
                    discard the rest.</li>
                <li>Score the interior/stomach side of the squid (not the 
                    exterior) by making diagonal cuts.</li>
                <li>Cut the piece into multiple smaller triangles.</li>    
            </ul>
            <p>The scoring helps the squid curl up into a beautiful horn when 
                it's cooked in boiling water.</p>
            <p>Then, we'll marinate the squid by placing mixing baking soda 
                (0.50 tsp) and water (0.50 tsp) in an empty bowl, and then 
                mixing the squid back in.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 5</b> <br>
            <p>We'll cut our about half of our tilapia fillets (1 lb) into 
            ~1 cm slices, and marinate it with salt (0.25 tsp), cornstarch 
            (1 tsp), water (2 tbsp), and white pepper (to taste).</p>
            <p>Mix the flavors in an empty bowl first, and then mix in the 
                fish.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 6</b> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Finely mince tilapia (0.50 lb), and beat it down to 
                    flatten it. Repeat.</li>
                <li>Finely mince shrimp (0.15 lb), and beat it down to 
                    flatten it. Repeat.</li>
                <li>Mix the tilapia and shrimp together, and flatten it.</li>
                <li>Finely chop cilantro (4 piece), green onion (4 piece), 
                    a rehydrated dried orange peel, and ginger</li>
                <li>Mix salt (1 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), white pepper (0.50 tsp), 
                    chicken bouillon (1 tsp), egg (1 ), cornstarch (3 tbsp) 
                    in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the fish paste and greens to the bowl, and mix 
                    thoroughly for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sesame oil (1 tsp), olive oil (1 tsp), mix for another 
                    30-60 seconds.</li>
                <li>Take clumps of fish paste and slam it down on the bowl 
                    - this helps increase the pliability of the fish paste.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes</li>
            </ul>
        <p>When it comes time to eat, we'll scoop up a ball of fish paste with 
            a spoon, and then dunk it in the hot pot. It will be ready to eat 
            in a little under a minute - soft, chewy, tender goodness and all.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 7</b> <br>
            Stir in green onions, peanuts and sesame oil. Toss well and 
            continue to cook for a further 2 minutes to infuse all of the 
            flavours together.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 8</b> <br>
            All we need to do is peel our daikon (1.5 lb), cut it in half, and 
            then cut it up into about 1 cm slices. We'll start boiling our hot 
            pot broth with daikon, and then eat it at the end after it's soaked 
            up all of the delicious flavors from the other foods.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 9</b> <br>
            For my dad's dipping sauce, we'll be mixing light soy sauce (4 tbsp), 
            Shacha sauce (1 tbsp), olive oil (1 tbsp), sesame oil (0.50 tbsp), 
            oyster sauce (4 tbsp), salt (1 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), chicken bouillon 
            (1 tsp), chili oil (0.50 tsp), and boiled water (4 tbsp).
        </li>
