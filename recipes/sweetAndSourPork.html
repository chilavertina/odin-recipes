    <h3>How to cook</h3>
    <p>Don't call the takeaway - cook your own sweet & sour pork using a 
        vibrant marinade and tinned pineapple. Swap the pork for chicken 
        or prawns if you prefer</p>
        <br>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pork fillet (about 500g), trimmed and cut into 3cm chunks</li>
        <li>sunflower or vegetable oil, for deep-frying</li>
        <li>cooked rice or noodles, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Step 1</b> <br>
            Mix the pork with the marinade ingredients and leave to sit 
            for at least 15 mins, or chill for a few hours. In a separate 
            bowl, mix all the coating ingredients. Drain any excess liquid 
            off the pork and toss the pork in the seasoned coating. Can be 
            done 1 hr ahead.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 2</b> <br>
            To make the sauce, heat the oil in a shallow saucepan and 
            gently fry the garlic, ginger and peppers until just starting 
            to soften. Now drop in all the rest of the ingredients except 
            the sesame seeds. Bring everything to the boil and cook for a 
            few mins until thickened, then take off the heat. To make the 
            batter, whisk the flours and baking powder together with 200ml 
            water to a smooth paste.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Step 3</b> <br>
            Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer, large saucepan or a wok to 
            180C or until a drop of batter sizzles and browns in 20 secs. 
            Dip the marinated pork in the batter mix (do it in two or three 
            batches) and let any excess drip off. Fry the pork in batches 
            for about 5-6 mins or until golden. Remove and drain on kitchen 
            paper until all the batches are done. Make sure you bring the 
            oil back to the correct temperature between each batch. Coat 
            the crispy pork in the sauce, then sprinkle over the sesame 
            seeds, coriander and serve with rice or noodles.
